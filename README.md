# ApplicationEmailMonitor
Sift through your gmail to find out which companies rejected you/companies you applied for returned to you in a spreadsheet. 

## Idea
I was applying to a lot of companies and it was hard to keep track. I didnt want to manually keep track so I thought maybe having a model that returns all my emails will show me which companies I applied to, and which rejected me.
